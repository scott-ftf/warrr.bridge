>*NOTE: This project is under developement and not yet functional - DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE ANY FILES IN THIS REPO*

This app is a interface for interacting with the wARRR contracts on both the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum networks. It provides functinality for the wARRR Bridge Claim Program described at the link below.

This was made specifically for the MetaMask browser extension and hasn't been tested with other wallets. 


## Accessing Online

The wARRR Bridge Claim App can be accessed online with a browser here:<br />

## Using App Locally

This app could alternatively be cloned and run locally. To function correctly, Web3 HTML files need to be served from a web server. They require *web3 injection*, which can't occur if the files are opened directly from a local file system in a browser. 

In a Linux operating system, for example, you can create a local server using the following command from the root directory of the repo:
```shell 
python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1
```

## ⚠️ Note to All Users: Carefully Review All MetaMask Prompts

>This tool cannot alter your balances on its own. It only sends requests to the web3 wallet. Always check the fees, amounts, and destination addresses in each wallet prompt carefully before approval.
